## React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a project I explored with to learn React. I followed the Intro to React tutorial on the official React website to create this Tic Tac Toe game.

I have made some modifications to this so it looks better :) 
- Responsiveness (enlarged game board on full screen desktop)
- Tie Game (the original tutorial had "next move" displayed when neither players won, which seemed incorrect to me)
- Color (I changed the color of the X's and O's to make it look better)
